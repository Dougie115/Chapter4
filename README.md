This repository includes solutions for chapter 4 programming exercises D.S.Malik Programming Design.
In order to get the code working copy paste the code onto the .cpp and test. These programs were
built with the methods learned up to Chapter 4. New solved exercises will be added in the future. They may be optimized
in newer repositories related to this book.
